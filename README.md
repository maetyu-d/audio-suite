Microsound is, as the name suggests, a sound generation application based around generating microsound, with plenty of strange/different/new generation techniques, most notably the ability to produce an initial transient at very high sample rates (bandlimited or not), and then unfold this transient by up to hundreds of times in the time domain, and/or stretch its spectrum by up to x4.0.
